Hail boredom sweet pretender
Egocentric manic mender

You love yourself,
But hate the man that's under
I've got full serenity,
And you're the sound of thunder

I can't believe why you bother to play them
Sit at home pretend to listen to Mayhem
Bought the t-shirt, got the flag
Your life is such a deadly drag

You love yourself,
But hate the man that's under
I've got full serenity,
And you're the sound of thunder
What did you miss?
Tell me what did you miss?
There is nothing greater than this
And you'll never come home

I don't listen to a single word you say
We'll be like unison in perfect disarray
You beg for all of the things they say,
Those are the garbage gods
That you wrongly praise
