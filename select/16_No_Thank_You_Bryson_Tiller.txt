Downtown Seattle on a weekend
You live kinda close, but not too close
Hit yo' FaceTime, are you decent
It's nine o'clock, you either naked or you fully clothed
Why you in a club on a Thursday
These niggas always thirsty, and it's full of those
Matching pajama season is coming up
How we both single? Girl, we gone cut it close
'Cause you bad, bad, yeah you fine, fine
Tequila on pause you drinkin' white wine
Stella ain't wine I hope you know that
You say stop makin' fun of you or I go back to them stank hoes
To them girls that wear a bracelet on their ankles
To them Instragram models, who only worry about their angles

No, thank you
I know what I got, it ain't an angel
But I wouldn't trade yo' ass for no one
Even on your worst day I thank you for loving me
Even at my worst I know you're loving me
On days I don't put you first you still in love with me
Even at my worst I know you loving me
On days I don't put you first you still in love with me

Yeah, uh
So fuckin' with them bitches ain't no fair trade
Wish there was more ways to show I care, babe
Could fuck with someone else, it ain't the same thing

So, no, thank you
I know what I got, it ain't an angel
But I wouldn't trade yo' ass for no one
Even on your worst day I thank you for loving me (ah)
I know what I got, it ain't an angel
But I wouldn't trade yo' ass for no one
Even on your worst day I thank you for loving me
